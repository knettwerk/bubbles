# Bubbles

Testing and playing around with the canvas element. This is just a 2d test in order to see what it can do and what it is capable of. Playing around with the following items:
<ul>
  <li>Testing velocity</li>
  <li>Resizing the canvas</li>
  <li>Drawing on the canvas</li>
  <li>Animating objects on the canvas</li>
  <li>Storing objects in an array</li>
</ul>
